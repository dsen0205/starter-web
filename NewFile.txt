Typing is hard, we all know it. Pay attention to what you type; you won't be able to connect to "githib.com" or "guthub.com". In some cases, a corporate network may cause issues resolving the DNS record as well.

To make sure you are connecting to the right domain, you can enter the following command:

$ ssh -vT git@github.com
> OpenSSH_8.1p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3
> debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/you/.ssh/config
> debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
> debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 47: Applying options for *
> debug1: Connecting to github.com port 22.
